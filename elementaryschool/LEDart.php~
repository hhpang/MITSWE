MIT SWE will be holding a booth during the annual Cambridge Science Festival. This year, the booth will be on April 19
from 12-4pm at the Cambridge Public Library in the Game Corner. Students in elementary school or middle school will have the 
opportunity to experience the magic behind circuits while making fun greeting cards with LEDs in them! Materials include 3V batteries,
copper wire, LED Stickers (created by our very own MIT Media Lab), and various art supplies. As students create their art, we will
go over some basic circuit concepts, including current, voltage potentials, conductors, and insulators.
