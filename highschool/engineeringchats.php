High School Outreach - Engineering Chats

<?php include('../header2.php');?>

<!-- Body -->

<p>
Engineering chats are a chance for MIT students to come to
your classroom and inspire students to pursue a career in science, technology, math and science (STEM) fields.   This is a great opportunity for students to gain insight into the life of a college engineering student, learn what opportunities are available in STEM fields, and have the opportunity to ask questions concerning STEM.  Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes and include a hands on activity for the students, information about upcoming SWE events, and more!

<p>Please contact engineeringchats@mit.edu if you are interested in having us come to your classroom!
