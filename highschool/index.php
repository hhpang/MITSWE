<h3>Build-A-Gadget</h3>
<h4>An electrical engineering workshop for high school students.</h4>

Circuits and voltage in physics class are cool, but using them to build gadgets is even cooler! Come build awesome gadgets including an LED game, a USB and a pencil-drawn piano that you can play! No experience or background knowledge required - just come ready to tinker with LEDs and resistors, andÂ be ready to have some fun! The workshop will take place in October and is hosted at MIT by the MIT Society of Women Engineers. <p><p>
