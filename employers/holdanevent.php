Hold an Event with MIT SWE

<?php include('../header2.php');?>

<!-- Body -->

<h4>If you would like to co-host an event with MIT SWE, you are just an email away from getting to a great start! 
Email the <a href="mailto:swe-cr@mit.edu">Corporate Relations and Professional Development team</a> to begin 
the process.</h4>

<br>

<p>Our goal is to have companies come to campus and hold unique, interesting events geared either toward the 
Corporate Relations side, like networking, industry panel, recruitment, etc. or Professional Development, such 
as programming competitions, presentations about job experiences, how to work with other cultures, etc.</p>

<p>We will work to tailor an event with for your specific company or if you would like to attract a broader range 
of students, we can organize a melting pot of companies under a unifying theme. The event can be advertised to 
either only MIT SWE members or the MIT community overall.</p>
