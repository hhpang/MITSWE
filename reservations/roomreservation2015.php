<p><h4>When you need to request a room for SWE events, fill out this form! The secretary needs this request at least 2 weeks before the event for the fastest processing. </p>

<p><b>CPW news</b>
<br>
<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
    <li>Requesting rooms that will occur during CPW must be submitted before FEBRUARY 22 (so that I can have enough time to request them). </li>
    <li>And filling out this link for cpw is preferable and filling out the form with all the additional details as if registering for a classroom reservation. </li>

<b>Why should I get my child involved (parent)?</b>
<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
    <li>Our programs are run by MIT students that are passionate enough about STEM outreach to volunteer their skills, time, and energy</li>
    <li>We believe that learning should be fun and never boring</li>
    <li>MIT provides us with amazing connections to see world class research and meet inspiring students, professors, and alumni</li>
    <li>STEM occupations are projected to grow by 17.0 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to 9.8 percent growth for non-STEM occupations and workers command 26% higher wages than non-STEM peers (US Dept. of Commerce, ï¿½STEM: Good Jobs Now and For Future, 2011)</li>
    <li>It's free!</li>
