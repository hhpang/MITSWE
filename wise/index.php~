<h3>What is WiSE?</h3>

<p>Through the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) program, MIT SWE 
hopes to encourage young women to explore science and engineering as potential 
career paths. By matching participants with MIT mentors based on similar 
interests, WiSE offers high school girls opportunities to deepen their 
understanding of a specific field of study, and gain awareness of the increasing 
role and importance of women in science, engineering, and technology. WiSE will 
establish a network of high school educators, and MIT students and faculty to 
introduce participants to the scientific community. The cornerstones of WiSE are 
guidance, vision, and empowerment, with the ultimate goal of inspiring participants 
to realize their potential in a future career path.</p>

</p>WiSE is a year-long, outreach program that provides 30 high school girls with 
opportunities and resources to explore science and engineering. Each year, the program 
is open to female students that possess the desire to learn about these fields and is 
meant to serve those in the Greater Boston area. WiSE will start with a kick-off 
conference during which the participants will meet and get paired with their MIT student 
mentors. These mentors will serve as gateways to enriching each participant's academic 
interests. Mentors are encouraged to communicate with participants between WiSE sessions 
to provide support in career exploration. WiSE sessions consist of lectures and panels 
held by MIT students and professors, visits to MIT laboratories, and discussions with 
peers sharing similar interests and passions. They encompass a multitude of focuses, 
ranging from cutting-edge research to the college admissions process. In the spring, 
WiSE hosts a speech contest to develop confidence and presentation skills while 
crystallizing participants’ interest in science, engineering, and technology. The heart of 
WiSE lies in preparing young women for making smart decisions about and taking action toward 
their studies and career goals.</p>
