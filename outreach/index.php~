<p><h4>Outreach is the largest section of MIT SWE, where we work to create programming that helps inspire over 800 students per year to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education and careers.</p>

<p>See below to to find a listing of all of our outreach programming, to join our mailing list (if you are MIT-affiliated), and to find 
where to direct your questions!</h4></p><br>



<p><b>What do we do?</b>
<br>
<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
    <li>Encourage students, especially young women and girls, to pursue STEM education in order to promote learning, spark curiosity, position themselves for future success, and build confidence in their abilities</li>
    <li>Develop and host free, high quality recurring and one time programming for students PreK-12 through both physical and virtual connections</li>
    <li>Promote STEM as a driving force for solutions to the community and world�s challenges</li>
    <li>Give MIT students the opportunity to inspire another generation and learn coaching, communication, and organizational skills</li>
</ul><br>
Please find a list of our current programming below.<br>

</ul><br>
<b>Why should I get my child involved (parent)?</b>
<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
    <li>Our programs are run by MIT students that are passionate enough about STEM outreach to volunteer their skills, time, and energy</li>
    <li>We believe that learning should be fun and never boring</li>
    <li>MIT provides us with amazing connections to see world class research and meet inspiring students, professors, and alumni</li>
    <li>STEM occupations are projected to grow by 17.0 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to 9.8 percent growth for non-STEM occupations and workers command 26% higher wages than non-STEM peers (US Dept. of Commerce, �STEM: Good Jobs Now and For Future, 2011)</li>
    <li>It's free!</li>
