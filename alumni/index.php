<h3>Meet the Professionals Dinner</h3>
In an informal dinner setting, MIT alumni from a range of companies including BAE Systems,

job experiences, answer questions that students have, and to share fun memories of their MIT
career. If you are interested in participing in our next dinner, please contact our Professional
Development Chairs <a href="mailto:pritee@mit.edu">Pritee Tembhakar and Julia Jakolska</a>.
