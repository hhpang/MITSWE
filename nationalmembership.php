<h3>Why Join National SWE?</h3>

Registering as a national SWE member will broaden and enrich your SWE experience! 
As a registered national SWE member at MIT, you gain access to members-only events 
including networking events, career development opportunities, social events, personal 
development events, and more. It is also important to join SWE as a national member 
because only then can you be recognized as a SWE member by MIT, SWE, and outside 
employers. Additionally, only registered national SWE members can run for SWE Board 
and Exec positions within MIT SWE. National SWE also offers additional benefits to 
members, including:
