<p>
I am a Technical Lead at 21st Century Technologies (21CT) in the Asymmetric Threat Group (ATG) which does a variety of work related to counter-terrorism.  Half my time is spent researching and developing new techniques for analyzing communication data, and the other half is spent managing a small team of engineers.
</p><p>
The working environment at 21CT is relaxed—there are no strict guidelines about our work schedules.  Most people work about 40 hrs a week, so there is definitely time to have a life outside of work.  People keep their doors open, and they are more than happy to answer your questions.  I think the working environment at 21CT is one of its biggest draws, and I don’t think you’ll find a better one in the industry.
</p><p>
My colleagues are some of the most intelligent and multi-talented individuals I’ve ever met.  I have an immense admiration for their professionalism, ability to learn, and willingness to help.  The managers at 21CT have been great role models to me, and being recently promoted to a manager has given me a strong appreciation for their managerial skills.
</p><p>
One of the reasons I chose to work at 21CT was because it offered opportunities to quickly make an impact.  Within 9 months of starting my job, I was given a large, open-ended project to work on.  Now, only 2 years after starting, I am in the process of patenting an algorithm that I developed, and I’m busy leading my own team
</p><p>
Austin is a diamond in the rough--it offers great food, an awesome nightlife, superb weather, and it’s inexpensive to live here!  Austin is small enough that you don’t have to share it with a million other people, but large enough that it offers almost everything that a major metropolitan city does.  Since the working hours at 21CT are reasonable, I’ve been fortunate enough to explore all the great things that Austin has to offer.
</p><p>
As a research-oriented company, 21CT encourages its employees to pursue a higher education. The company will pay for employees to pursue their Masters or PhD at the University of Texas while working.  It’s a great way to earn the PhD that you always wanted while living like a professional.
</p><p>
I think the best way to succeed at 21CT is to pitch in however you can.  Since the company is small and growing, your suggestions are heard. You have the ability to improve the processes, the workplace, and the culture and make it a place you want to be rather than a place you have to be. It has afforded me many opportunities to be a leader and to shine among my teammates.
