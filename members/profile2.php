IBM has offered me a career far beyond anything I could have imagined. The breadth and depth of opportunity at IBM has been one of my greatest rewards.  As an IBMer, we are fortunate to experience many different career choices. Diverse opportunities abound as we span from basic sciences to deep silicon technology to services and solutions for our customers. As an Engineer, there are many choices, some of which include deep technology work or customer-facing roles giving you exposure to IBM’s best of breed technology in the marketplace.
</p><p>
My career in the development arena allows me to stay close to the business side of IBM. Personally, I find this exciting and challenging because of the direct impact to IBM. One of my assignments as Verification and Technology Director is to interface between deep technology and the customer and  to translate the complex systems into a value which the customer can seamlessly relate to their business.
</p><p>
One of the most pleasant aspects of my job is my role as a communicator. My mission is to successfully articulate the technological issues so they can be understood by internal executives, the sales team, technologists as well as external customers.  Playing a key role in bringing innovative solutions into the marketplace is valuable to me as an IBMer.
</p><p>
I enjoy building my organization of 350 people and helping individuals with their career growth.  Matching opportunities to fit people is both challenging and rewarding.  A focus for me in my career is mentoring women in engineering.  I enjoy creating a network of women with common professional interests.  IBM supports and encourages work/life flexibility,providing balance and support to our women engineers.  We respect, require and encourage diversity of thought in our product teams and marketing.
</p><p>
IBM recruits and retains top engineering talent in the business, this strength makes IBM stand out as an energized and exciting place to work. Bright minds… Nobel prize winners, Distinguished Engineers, Fellows, Master Inventors….who innovate and create products we sell in the marketplace. We work in an incredibly high performance, technologically challenged environment.  We strive to achieve state of the art in all we do. Teams work together as a unit, sharing ideas, challenging one another, relying on the expertise of each team member.
</p><p>
IBM mentors and advisors play an essential role in your career.  These folks provide advice, experience and  help you to make choices in your future career.   
</p><p>
Speak Up!  Women need to communicate  to express their career goals, concerns and job interests. Think of your jobs in terms of what you are able to accomplish and your career as a series of accomplishments. Performance is key to success and satisfaction. Do well and leave when you have accomplished something of which you are proud. This is always a good end point.
