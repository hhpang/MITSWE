<h3>MIT SWE Member Expectations</h3>

<p>MIT SWE Board members, as leaders in the MIT SWE community, are expected to uphold certain 
commitments as a part of their positions.  These activities help to support the growth and 
vitality of the MIT SWE Section, and should also further your personal development as leaders.
These are our expectations for the SWE Board:</p>

<p><ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Attend all board meetings (~6 per semester)</li>
<li>Volunteer for at least two Outreach events per semester</li>
<li>Attend at least one Corporate Relations event per semester</li>
<li>Attend at least one SWE social event per semester</li>
<li>Sign up for one booth shift per semester (Orientation, CPW, SWE Gear booth, etc.)</li>
<li>Volunteer for the MIT Career Fair</li>
<li>Attend any MIT-hosted SWE conferences and volunteer for one shift</li>
</ul></p>

<!--p>A handbook for SWE Board members including detailed member resources, expectations and 
consequences is in progress and will be released by September 2011 when we kick off this 
new system for the fall semester.</p-->

<p>While national SWE members at MIT who aren't serving on our board aren't required to participate 
in all of these activities, a lot of them are great ways to get involved, meet new people, and 
learn more about SWE! This is also a good way to learn more about what board positions are like 
if you're interested in applying for one. We encourage you to:</p>

<p><ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
<li>Attend planning board meetings - they are open to national members!</li>
<li>Attend SWE events like social events, networking events, professional development events, and personal development events</li>
<li>Volunteer for Outreach events, the SWE booth, the MIT Career Fair, and other events SWE is hosting</li>
<li>Check out our calendar to see what's coming up next</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We hope to see you at our events in Spring 2014!</p>
