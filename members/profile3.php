Momentum is not a term I use to describe what I studied in my college physics class; it is a sensation I feel in my bones. As a person who is passionate about life and the art of living, momentum is what propels me forward in time and in place. I love to combine my myriad interests in new and exciting ways to further my career and personal development. During college, I ran Varsity Track, volunteered at a local community center, and was a student liaison to the Duke Stores Committee. Although extremely busy, I enjoyed the challenges my major and my extracurricular activities presented me. I spent two summers during my undergraduate years working in New York City for one of the world's leading banks and wealth management firms. My experience there taught me the importance of balancing team collaboration with making an individual impact. I needed to ensure that the team was moving forward; that I was moving forward. <br><br>
						As I began to look for jobs during my senior year in college, it became increasingly apparent that accomplishments weren't everything. It was important to be a well-rounded individual with the ability to overcome challenges and solve difficult problems. When I found out about Appian Corporation, everything just seemed to fall into place.    
</p><p>
Fresh out of Duke University and armed with a Computer Science degree, I began my career as a technical consultant in the summer of 2004. Appian delivers professional services and software solutions for large commercial and governmental organizations. I was thrilled to be working for a young, smart, and dynamic company, which prides itself on the abilities of its people by making a large investment in each and every employee. 
</p><p>
After a 5-week training program called Appian Academy, I was placed on a small, but high profile project for West Point and, ultimately, the U.S. Army. Not even three weeks out of training, I was in front of our client, fleshing out the design for an online behavioral assessment and tracking system. Soon thereafter, I was building one of the most requested features for Army Knowledge Online (AKO), the largest intranet in the world. I not only honed my technical skills, but I gained exposure and experience supporting the largest intranet in the world- I was having an immediate impact.
</p><p>
By the beginning of 2005, I became one of the founding members of a new department aimed at targeting new vertical markets for our software product. It was not long before I was managing my own projects and deliverables. My day-to-day activities included cultivating new and existing partner relationships, going on sales calls, conducting product and solution demonstrations, market research, and even technical development. The wide-range of experiences that Appian has afforded me are truly unique; I have helped shape new products, speak with potential customers, build on my technical skills and analyze our market. At the same time, I have been able to shape my own career path, and this is what sets Appian apart from other companies.
</p><p>
Appian's commitment to cultural diversity and the development of its talented employees, has given me the opportunity to become a well-known leader. I am president of both a social special interest group, as well as a group focused on community service. I am also an active mentor for new hires and I frequently travel to colleges and universities across the U.S. to find other talented individuals with the drive to move forward; with a personal sense of momentum.
