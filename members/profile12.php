<p>
I'm the Director of Data Ingest in the Platform Engineering group at Endeca. I work with the Product Management team to understand our business drivers and priorities and drive a group to deliver the product that meets the business goals. We're a technically-driven product company so I also work with architects and the CTO to make sure we're evolving the product towards our technical vision (which I help to create). 
</p><p>
Every day feels very different and presents new challenges to solve.  Over the course of a week, I:
</p><p>
- Meet with managers in my team to make sure we have solid delivery plans;
<br>- Learn new technologies that we may want to integrate with;
<br>- Decide how to staff projects and hire new team members;
<br>- Manage relationships with vendors;
<br>- Learn about projects specific customers have deployed;
<br>- Help troubleshoot issues they might be having;
<br>- Present to management the status of projects and our plan;
<br>- Use our product and prepare demos;
<br>- Coordinate with other directors to make sure all of our projects are fitting together to provide customers with a complete product;
<br>- Provide design reviews;
<br>- and every once and I while I still find time to code.

</p><p>
I get really excited about every release we work on because of the value that we're going to deliver to customers.  We make  customers' lives easier so they can analyze and solve problems in brand new ways.  I have a lot of pride in my team and the quality of the work we deliver.
</p><p>
Endeca is full of very smart people. We recruit from top schools and most of the engineers have very strong backgrounds in database development, since Endeca is building a new type of database that combines a database with a search engine.  Everyone is very motivated and driven by solving technical challenges.  We use agile development which means we work on projects in priority order and revise estimates every month, as we learn more.  This means that the hours are very reasonable because we don't have to cram in work because we underestimated.  Most people arrive before their daily standup meeting at 10 am (but some teams don't meet until 11 am!) and the office gets fairly quiet after 5:30 or 6 pm.  Although I don't need to, I often work even longer because I'm excited about our projects.
</p><p>
At first I wanted to work at Endeca because of the people.  I wanted to work somewhere that had really strong engineers creating innovative technology.  After I learned more about the company, I got even more excited about how different our product was and I thought about how useful it would have been to use Endeca's product in most of the projects I worked on at other companies.  We're able to integrate data from any system even if it's structured differently (or may not have any structure at all) and put it into a single index, immediately allowing users to search, navigate, and analyze their data, finding relationships they were never able to find before. It's my job to make the data integration as fast and easy as possible.
</p><p>
Many people socialize with co-workers outside of work, and there is something for everyone.  There are card games, ultimate Frisbee, softball, or just grabbing some drinks.  There is always something happening and we even have a social committee in engineering to plan events. While there is always something to do, I often go home to make dinner with my husband because my family is an important priority to me.
</p><p>
When I first left MIT after working on my MEng in course 6-3, I started as a software engineer at a consulting firm and grew into a senior engineer.  At my next company, I brought a lot of my experiences and improved our software development and release processes and eventually moved into management which I found that I loved and wanted to focus on for my career.
</p><p>
The best advice I can give is to work hard and deliver high quality work. Go above and beyond to contribute to the success of your team and company. Build strong relationships with everyone. And finally, suggest solutions to address problems you see. No matter which company you work for or which position you hold, these are the things that create endless opportunities for you.
