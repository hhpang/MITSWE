<p>
I am the Head of Banking and Capital Markets for Europe based out of Amsterdam currently. I have around 25 years of experience in the IT industry and started my career as a software engineer fresh out of college many years ago. I did my engineering degree in Computer Science and am fortunate enough to be working in the same field I did my education in, with a very interesting vertical like Banking and Capital Markets to apply the knowledge in. I have had the opportunity to work through the ranks in the top two IT organizations in India, namely Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Technologies Limited to my current position as Unit Head where I am responsible for both business development and end-to-end delivery for our existing customer base of Fortune 1000 financial services companies in Europe.

This experience has given me an well rounded perspective of the IT industry and has also positioned me very well to guide and mentor new entrants to this industry. I have found that it is necessary to remain hands-on in technology to the extent of being upto date on new technologies and their applicability to address different pain points in the industry that one works in. Doing this enables one to be well respected amongst everyone that you interact with including the team, peers and customers. I have found that volunteering to teach courses, writing articles or talking in seminars or workshops, etc. are good ways to keep touch with technology and the outside world. Software Engineering is a very exciting field to be in today, specially with all the developments in mobile technologies, cloud computing, etc. and the possibilities of applying them to our current challenges are endless – my advice to all of you is to stay current with technology trends while applying them to real life situations and you will always be on top of your career.
