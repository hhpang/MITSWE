<p>
					Working for eBay in the engineering department is a very rewarding
					experience. I am surrounded by the most energetic, devoted and smartest
					people.  I am provided with the most technically challenging problems in
					the world to solve in terms of the volume of data, a codebase that
					rivals many of today's popular operating systems in its size and
					complexity, and a business unit that demands short time to market for
					its initiatives. But most importantly, I know that my efforts benefit
					millions of eBay community members all over the world. Do you know that
					more than 1.3 million people make their living on eBay (excluding ebay
					employees)?
</p><p>
					I am a senior development manager at eBay. I joined eBay two and a half
					years ago. My team is responsible for building asynchronous systems to
					meet eBay's scalability, performance and reliability needs.  We
					developed and patented many of the infrastructure components which
					outperform anything commercially available.  Part of my typical day as a
					leader and a manager in the development organization is to help the team
					to prioritize the tasks, to provide the vision and strategy, to
					collaborate across different organizations to reach a goal, and to do
					resource and project management. I also spend a fair amount of time
					drilling down into the details of the technical issues, monitoring our
					code in production to ensure high availability and that we are
					efficiently utilizing our systems. Another interesting task is to
					provide a fun work place for the team(s). My team enjoys going to
					Yoshi's Jazz club in Oakland or playing Bocce ball in Los Gatos as much
					as white boarding complex problem resolution and sharing laughs over
					non-work related activities. My job really unites my passion of working
					with people and my drive for cool technologies together.
</p><p>
					I started programming in Panasonic as a part-time employee when I was in
					graduate school. Finding my first job after school was very straight
					forward.  I joined a few start-up companies, then later a few bigger
					companies (like Compuware and Netscape/AOL), and I finally landed at
					eBay a few years back.  What motivated me besides the technological
					challenges the most is the influence I can make. It is extremely
					rewarding to know every day that tens of thousands or even millions of
					people may depend on what I do today.
</p><p>
					Back in college in China, women in the engineering school were called
					oasis. In the work place, woman engineers are still the minority.
					However many of the woman engineers I have known are the best engineers
					and the best engineering managers. I see many great woman engineers who
					are very detail oriented and they make few mistakes in design/coding.
					This makes a huge difference to the mission critical business. I also
					observe that great women leaders do fabulous jobs with collaboration
					tasks, people management and mentoring. Many of them are the best made
					managers.
</p><p>
					Now, it's up to you to go search your passion, build your credit, be
					aggressive and enjoy your success in all aspects of your life.
